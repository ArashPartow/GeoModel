## Reference counting


!!! warning
    The custom reference counting used in GeoModel was developed when no smart pointers were available for C++. That part will be the object of a major refactoring in the near future.


Many objects need to be allocated in the description of a complicated geometry. For efficient use of memory, these should be shared as often as possible. The extensive sharing of objects in a geometry system calls for a way of destroying the objects as soon as they are not usedâ€”by any other object that references them. The scheme for doing this is called reference counting. In the GeoModelKernel classes, it is achieved by mixing in a abstract base class, RCBase:

```cpp
//RCBase
  Constructor:
    RCBase()
  Public Methods:
    void ref ()
    void unref ()
    unsigned int refCount ()
```

`RCBase` is inherited by many of the classes in the geometry system. Reference-counted objects can only be created using operator new, and cannot be created on the stack. The methods `ref()` and `unref()` can be called to increase or decrease the reference count of an object. When the reference count decreases to zero, the object deletes itself. The accessor `refCount()` returns the current reference count.
