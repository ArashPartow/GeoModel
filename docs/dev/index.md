# Build the GeoModel libraries

Here below, you will find instructions on how to compile the GeoModel libraries from scratch. You can want to do that for different reasons:

- you want to build the libraries for an OS which is not officially supported or for a version of it for which no pre-compiled packages are provided (for info, see the [Start](/start/install.md) section)
- you want to test the latest version of the code
- you want to contribute to the development of the libraries

In the following, you will find basic strategies to effectively build the GeoModel libraries, based on different use cases. For more details, you can find updated and additional instructions inside the `README` file of the [GeoModelVisualization/README.md](https://gitlab.cern.ch/GeoModelDev/GeoModelVisualization/README.md) specific package.
